# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Deep Learning

## This project using LSTM Deep Learning Method for Intrusion Detection System, aims to measure accuracy in detecting attacks

## Framework & API's

- Tensorflow-GPU
- Keras

## Tools

- Google Colab (Google Compute Engine Python 3)

Dataset: KDD Cup 99 -> this is the data set used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99 The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining

## This project divided into two components that are Binary Classification and Multiclass Classification

Dataset for Binary Classification in directory `/dataset/kdcup99-binary-dataset.csv`

Dataset for Multiclass Classification in directory `/dataset/kdcup99-multiclass-dataset.csv`
