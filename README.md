# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Deep Learning

## This project ty to implement LSTM Method in Intrusion Detection System in Network Security, aims to measure accuracy in detecting attacks

Dataset: KDD Cup 99 -> this is the data set used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99 The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining

Run: in Google Colab

## This project divided into two components that are Binary Classification and Multiclass Classification

Dataset for Binary Classification in directory /dataset/kdcup99-binary-dataset.csv

Dataset for Multiclass Classification in directory /dataset/kdcup99-multiclass-dataset.csv
